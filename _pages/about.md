I am current PhD Student in the field of Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University. I am also research assistant at Sensor, Signal and Information Processing (SenSIP) Center at Arizona State University. My research mainly focuses on machine learning, computer vision, signal processing and data analysis. I work with different modalities of data such as, audio data, clinical time series data, video data and have employed state-of-art deep learning algorithms such as, Temporal Convolutional Networks, Dilated Densenets , LSTMS and GANs towards applications such as, Object detection, Audio Source Separation, EEG based abnormality detection , Arrhythmia Classification and weather forecasting. I have recently been looking into meta learning and Differential Privacy style methods for task semantics understanding and data encryption for diagnostics respectively.
