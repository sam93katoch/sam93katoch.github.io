I am PhD Student at Arizona State University specializing in Computer Vision focusing on aspects of Time Series Prediction. My research interests include Image Processing, computer vision, and machine learning.Furthermore, I am also research assistant at Sensor, Signal and Information Processing (SenSIP) Center at Arizona State University.

Recently, I completed my summer internship with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where I developed differential privacy style methods for data encryption in diagnostic applications. I work with different modalities of data such as, audio data, clinical time series data, video data and have employed state-of-art deep learning algorithms such as, Temporal Convolutional Networks, Dilated Densenets , LSTMS and GANs towards applications such as, Object detection, Audio Source Separation, EEG based abnormality detection , Arrhythmia Classification and weather forecasting. I have recently been looking into meta learning and Differential Privacy style methods for task semantics understanding and data encryption for diagnostics respectively.

Iâ€™m eternally excited about new ideas! Shoot me an email if you want to chat!
