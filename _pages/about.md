I am currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Qualcomm in the Multimedia group where I develop deep learning models with the power and latency constraints such that they can be used at the edge. I have worked with different modalities of data such as, image data, audio data, clinical time series data, video data and have employed state-of-art machine and deep learning algorithms such as, Logistic Regression, K-Means, Convolutional Neural Networks, Temporal Convolutional Networks, Dilated Densenets, U-Nets, ResNets, LSTMs and Transformers towards applications such as, Semantic Segmentation, Object detection and tracking, Image Classification, Domain Generalization, EEG based abnormality detection, Arrhythmia Classification, Audio Source Separation, weather forecasting and privacy preserving diagnostics.  

Iâ€™m eternally excited about new ideas! Shoot me an email if you want to chat!
